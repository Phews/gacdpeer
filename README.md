Getting and cleaning data - peer assignment
========

The script in this repository is meant for cleaning data of Peer assignment in "Getting and cleaning data"" course. 

Running the scripts assumes that working directory contains data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip following the structure of zip folder. Working directory should be the place of the features.txt (and of course the other files in the same directory).

There's one script doing all the work. So all you need to run is run_analysis.R, which creates the tidy data set.
